DESCRIPTION					     *ArgsAndMore-description*

This plugin supports you with batch processing many files by extending the
built-in |:windo|, |:argdo|, etc. commands. You can filter the argument list,
add files _not_ matching a pattern, convert between arguments and quickfix
list, and apply arbitrary Ex commands (also partially) via |:Argdo|, then
analyze any errors and retry on an argument list where the successfully
processed arguments have been removed.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- The :ArgsNegated command was inspired by the following Stack Overflow
  question:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11547662/how-can-i-negate-a-glob-in-vim

==============================================================================
USAGE							   *ArgsAndMore-usage*

								      *:Windo*
:Windo {cmd}		Execute {cmd} in each window, then return back to the
			original one.
								   *:Winbufdo*
:Winbufdo {cmd}		Execute {cmd} in each different buffer shown in one of
			the windows in the current tab page (once per buffer),
			then return back to the original one.
								      *:Tabdo*
:Tabdo {cmd}	        Execute {cmd} once in each tab page, then return back
			to the original one.
								   *:Tabwindo*
:Tabwindo {cmd}		Execute {cmd} in each open window on each tab page,
			then return back to the original one.
								      *:Argdo*
:Argdo {cmd}		Execute {cmd} for each file in the argument list, then
			return back to the original file and argument.
:[range]Argdo {cmd}	Execute {cmd} for the [range] of indices from the
			argument list, then return back to the original file
			and argument.
			For example, to execute {cmd} on the remaining
			arguments, use :.,$Argdo {cmd}

			In contrast to |:argdo|, this also avoids the
			|hit-enter| prompt (all files will be processed
			without further interaction from you), and an error
			summary will be printed.
			To work on the errors / arguments with errors, you can
			use |:ArgdoErrors| and |:ArgdoDeleteSuccessful|.
								*:ArgdoErrors*
:ArgdoErrors		List all error messages that occurred during the last
			|:Argdo| command, and for each unique error, print the
			argument number and filespec.
						      *:ArgdoDeleteSuccessful*
:ArgdoDeleteSuccessful	Delete those arguments from the argument list that
			didn't cause any error messages during the last
			|:Argdo| command.

								 *:ArgsFilter*
:ArgsFilter {expr}	Apply the |filter()| of {expr} to the argument list,
			and keep only those where {expr} yields true. This
			allows you to |:argdelete| multiple arguments at once
			and to delete without specifying the full filename.
								*:ArgsNegated*
:ArgsNegated[!] {arglist}
			Define all files except {arglist} as the new argument
			list and edit the first one.

								   *:ArgsList*
:ArgsList[!] 	    	List each argument number and filespec in a neat list
			(not just one after the other as |:args|). With [!],
			expand all arguments to absolute filespecs.
:ArgsList[!] {glob}	List each argument number and filespec that matches
			(with [!]: does not match) {glob} in a neat list.
			Matching and printing is done to the full filespec.

							     *:ArgsToQuickfix*
:ArgsToQuickfix		Show all arguments as a quickfix list.

					      *:CListToArgs* *:CListToArgsAdd*
:CListToArgs		Convert the files in the quickfix list to arguments.
:[count]CListToArgsAdd
					      *:LListToArgs* *:LListToArgsAdd*
:LListToArgs		Convert the files in the window's location list to
:[count]LListToArgsAdd	arguments.

HISTORY							 *ArgsAndMore-history*

1.01	27-Aug-2012
- Do not use <f-args> because of its unescaping behavior.
- FIX: "E480: No match" on :ArgsNegated with ../other/path relative argument;
  need to issue a dummy :chdir to convert relative args before doing the
  :argdelete.
